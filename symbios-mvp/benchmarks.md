## 📈 Current Limitations

### Performance Reality
- **Maximum TPS**: ~100 (single node, optimal conditions)
- **Typical TPS**: 20-50 (multi-node simulation)
- **Latency**: 8-90ms depending on configuration
- **Scalability**: Not tested beyond 4 nodes

### Known Bottlenecks
1. **Sequential Processing**: No parallel transaction execution
2. **Simple Consensus**: Demo consensus adds overhead
3. **Storage I/O**: RocksDB operations limit throughput
4. **Network Latency**: Even local testing shows delays
